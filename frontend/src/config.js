                heading: 'Strawberry Leaf Scorch',
                summary: `Leaf scorch symptoms are very similar to the early stages of common (Mycosphaerella) leaf spot, with irregular dark purple spots being scattered over the upper leaf surface. As the spots enlarge, they begin to look like drops of tar, and are actually the accumulations of black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus. The centers of the spots remain purple (in Mycosphaerella leaf spot they are white) and there is no well-defined lesion border. In heavy infections, these regions coalesce and the tissue between the lesions often takes on a purplish to bright red color that is dependent on cultivar, temperature, or other factors. The leaves eventually turn brown, dry up, and curl at the margins giving the leaf a scorched appearance. Examination of the acervuli and conidial morphology can help to distinguish between leaf spot and leaf scorch at this advanced stage of disease. On the upper leaf surfaces of leaf scorch lesions, the acervuli are dark with glistening spore masses and dark apothecia. Petiole lesions are elongate, sunken, with a purplish to brown color and can kill the leaf by girdling the petiole. Runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps can also become infected. Plants may become weakened and the number and vigor of crowns reduced. Infection predisposes the plants to winter and drought stress. In severe infestations, flowers and fruit may die. Overall, there can be a serious reduction in yield in matted row systems. It has not been observed as a yield-reducing problem in annual production systems. In matted row or perennial strawberry systems, select a planting site with good air drainage and sun exposure. Cultivars resistant to leaf scorch may be available and need to be evaluated for specific horticultural characteristics. Plant new transplants frequently, and allow adequate spacing between them to increase airflow. Control weeds. Avoid amendment with supplemental nitrogen in spring, as this may enhance disease. Keep moisture levels down and avoid long wetness periods by monitoring irrigation schedules; if possible, use drip irrigation rather than overhead. Remove foliage and crop residues after picking or at renovation to remove inoculum and delay disease increase in late summer and fall. Fungicide treatments are effective during the flowering period, and during late summer and fall.
  
  In annual plasticulture production systems, the disease has not been observed to cause economic damage in fruiting fields and generally does not require action. Although symptoms may be on plants at the time of planting or soon after, the levels of disease are typically low and do not persist into the spring. In plug production facilities, high disease levels may affect the look of the plants and this decreased aesthetic value may impact sales. See our Strawberry IPM Guide at for current recommendations.`

                heading: 'Peach Bacterial Spot',
                summary: `Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Symptoms of this disease include fruit spots, leaf spots, and twig cankers. Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit. Early defoliated trees are reduced in vigor and winter hardiness. Fruit symptoms of bacterial spot may be confused with peach scab, caused by the fungus Cladosporium carpophyllium, however scab spots are more circular, have a dark brown/greenish, fuzzy appearance, and do not pit the fruit surface, although skin cracking can occur. Scab does not cause leaf symptoms but can cause spots on twigs. Initial fruit spots of bacterial spot may be superficial but develop into craters.`

                heading: 'Potato Late Blight',
                summary: ` Late blight caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans is the most important disease of potato that can result into crop failures in a short period if appropriate control measures are not adopted. Losses in potato yield can go as high as 80% in epidemic years. During  past years, epidemics of the disease have appeared in 1985-86, 1989-90, 1992-93, 1997-98, 2006-07  and recently during 2007-08 season. Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler irrigation can favor late blight; in Tule Lake under solid set sprinklers, conditions conducive to late blight development are enhanced by day time irrigation but not night time irrigation.
  
                  Plant certified seed tubers. When late blight has developed on foliage and tubers are at risk of infection, make sure that vines are completely dead for 2 to 3 weeks before harvest. Phytophthora infestans does not survive very long in dead foliage.
                  
                  In districts that are commonly subjected to outbreaks of late blight, preventive applications of fungicides are advised when environmental conditions are favorable for the disease. Continue fungicide applications at 7- to 10-day intervals as conditions require. Shorter intervals may be needed under cool, rainy conditions. In interior districts where late blight occurs sporadically, watch for disease symptoms during routine field monitoring, and record your results (example form—PDF). Apply fungicides when late blight lesions appear in the field or in nearby plantings.`

                heading: 'Potato Early Blight',
                summary: `Early blight is primarily a disease of stressed or senescing plants. Symptoms appear first on the oldest foliage. Affected leaves develop circular to angular dark brown lesions 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3–4 mm) in diameter. Concentric rings often form in lesions to produce characteristic target-board effect. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Infected tubers show a brown, corky dry rot. Early blight can be minimized by maintaining optimum growing conditions, including proper fertilization, irrigation, and management of other pests. Grow later maturing, longer season varieties. Fungicide application is justified only when the disease is initiated early enough to cause economic loss. Watch for disease symptoms during routine monitoring, and keep records of your results (example form—PDF). When justified, apply fungicides as soon as symptoms appear; continued protection requires application at 7- to 10-day intervals.`
